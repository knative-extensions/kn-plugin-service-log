// This documentation describes your plugin. It is written in Asciidoc, which
// is very similar to Markdown, but much more powerful (i.e. it allows comments
// like this)
// See the short reference at for the main commands: http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/
// Tip: Asciidoc authors often use to line-break after each sentence. That way, it's easier to move things around and to identify parts.

```
./hack/builds.sh
```

then move `kn-service-log` to `~/.config/kn/plugins/` and call kn with 

```

```
